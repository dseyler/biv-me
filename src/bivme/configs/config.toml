version = "1.1.3" # for semantic versioning - Major.Minor.Patch sequence
# e.g software version 2.3.1 means that the software is in its second major version,
# with three additional functionalities added, and one patch fix implemented.
# When a developer fixes a bug in that version, the next version release is named version 2.3.2.

[modules]
preprocessing = true
fitting = true
# Define which modules you want to run. 
# preprocessing generates GPFiles and SliceInfo files for biv model fitting directly from a DICOM directory
# fitting carries out biv model fitting on a set of GPFiles and SliceInfo files
# If both are enabled, they will be run in sequence, such that biv models will be generated for each case within a DICOM directory
# If only fitting is enabled, biv models will be created from existing GPFiles
# If only preprocessing is enabled, GPFiles and SliceInfo files will be created for each case within a DICOM directory 
# Allowed values:
# * true    : Run this module
# * false    : Do not run this module
# Default: true

[logging]
show_detailed_logging = true
# Change the log visibility for preprocessing and fitting. Useful for debugging and oversight.
# If true, detailed logs will show on the console.
# Default: true

generate_log_file = true
# Decide whether or not to save the log files. If true, a .log file will be generated each for preprocessing and fitting
# Default: true

###### Preprocessing parameters
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#

# Below are the parameters used to configure preprocessing of DICOM files 
# Skip these if you do not intend to run preprocessing
[input_pp]
source = "../../example/dicoms"
# Define the directory containing raw dicoms. Files must be grouped into one folder per case
# Default: "../../example/dicoms"

batch_ID = "test"
# Define the id of the batch you are processing. This will define the name of the folder that processed outputs will be written to
# Default: "test"

analyst_id = "analyst1"
# Define the id of the analyst performing the preprocessing. Useful e.g. if view predictions need to be corrected
# Default: "analyst1"

processing = "../../example/processing"
# Define the directory where processing files (including view predictions, segmentations) will be written
# Default: "../../example/processing"

states = "../../example/states"
# Define the directory where view predictions and log files will be written out to
# Default: "../../example/states"

[view-selection]
option = "default"
# Define how you would like to perform view selection
# * "default" : View predictions are generated by using metadata and image data
# * "metadata-only": View predictions are generated using metadata only
# * "image-only": View predictions are generated using image data only
# * "load" : View predictions are loaded from the states folder, if they exist
# Default: "default"

correct_mode = "adaptive"
# Define whether you would like to manually review and correct view predictions. "adaptive" is generally recommended to avoid downstream errors.
# * "manual": will launch a GUI after completing view predictions to allow you to correct any mispredictions
# * "adaptive": will only launch a GUI if there are any poor predictions or missing views
# * "automatic": will not launch the GUI and will use the predictions as they are with no interruption
# Default: "adaptive" 

[output_pp]
overwrite = false
# Define to overwrite the processed folder and outputs of an already preprocessed case, if it exists
# Default: false

generate_plots = true
# Define whether to generate html plots of exported contours after preprocessing. 
# Default: true

output_directory = "../../example/guidepoints"
# Define the directory where GPFiles will be created
# If fitting and preprocessing are both enabled, this output_directory will also be the gp_directory used for fitting (see below)

# * "average_all_frames"  : Breathold misregistration is calculated by averaging slice shift over all frame
# * "none"  : no correction applied
# Default: "derived_from_ed"

[gp_processing]
sampling = 1
# Controls whether to sample the data points or not. This can be useful when dealing with very dense data points.
